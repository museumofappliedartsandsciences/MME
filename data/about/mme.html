<h1>About MME</h1>

<p>The Museum Metadata Exchange (MME) project is a joint project of
  the Australasian Museum Directors (CAMD)
  and <a href="http://www.museumsaustralia.org.au/">Museums
  Australia</a> which has been set up with support from
  the <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/">Australian National Data
  Service</a> (ANDS). ANDS is supported by the Australian Government
  through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy
  Program and the Education Investment Fund (EIF) Super Science
  Initiative. The project is being hosted by the Powerhouse
  Museum. </p>

<p>The MME has been designed to harvest collection level descriptions
  from a number of major museums and the National Film and Sound
  Archive and to supply that data in a standardised format to the
  <a href="http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/">Australian
  Research Data Commons</a> (ARDC). </p>

<p>The selection of collections and search terms will be assisted by
  academic researcher communities. This ensure that, for the first
  time, many museum collections of particular interest to Humanities,
  Arts and Social Sciences (HASS) researchers will be readily
  discoverable through the ARDC.</p>


<p>The MME provides a finding aid for researchers and others by
  describing what is held in our national collection and where to go
  for further information.  It is essentially a catalogue of
  collections.</p>
