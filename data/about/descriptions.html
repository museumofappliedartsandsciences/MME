<h1>Collection Level Descriptions</h1>

<p>Museums and other collecting instutions have traditionally
  documented their collections at item level.  A collection level
  descriptions document groups of objects.</p>

<p>Object groupings can be defined in many ways including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object – e.g. the Chair Collection; the Swimwear Collection. </li>
<li>Collecting area – e.g. Australian Decorative Arts. </li>
<li>Person – e.g. Paul Keating Collection; Nancy-Bird Walton Collection. </li>
<li>Organisation – e.g. Victa Lawnmower Collection; Clyde Engineering Collection. </li>
<li>Slice of time – e.g. The 1950s; The Macquarie Era. </li>
<li>Concept or Theme – e.g. Innovation : The History of Powered Flight </li>
<li>Community – e.g. the Greek Cypriot Community; The Ukulele Community. </li>
<li>Place – e.g. The Rocks, Sydney; Tropical Queensland. </li>
<li>Event – e.g. 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games; The Prince Philip Design Award. </li>
<li>Process/Material – e.g. The Scrimshaw Collection; The Plastics Collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Collection level descriptions can provide an overview and meaning
  which can be difficult to concieve in dense object catalogues. </p>
