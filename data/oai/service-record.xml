<description type="brief">

The MME is an aggregator service which provides a finding aid for researchers and
others by describing collections held by Museums and other collecting institutions in
Australia. The service gives an overview of the collection and details of the holding
institution.

The Museum Metadata Exchange (MME) project is a joint project of the Council of
Australasian Museum Directors (CAMD) and Museums Australia which has been set
up with support from the Australian National Data Service (ANDS).

The MME is an aggregator service for the contributing museums and organisations. It
provides data in a standard format (RIF-CS) and transports this data to the Australian
Research Data Commons (ARDC). This same XML feed can also be downloaded by
others interested in the data.

The project is funded by ANDS to ensure that collection level descriptions are added
to Research Data Australia to be used and explored by academic researchers. The
research community, through the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS)
researchers, will be involved in the evaluation of the initial collections and search
terms and this review will inform future developments and collections contributed
to the MME. This will ensure that, for the first time, many museum collections of

particular interest HASS researchers will be readily discoverable through the ARDC.
